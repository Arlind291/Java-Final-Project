EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

EMS is a system that is built to be used only for the administrators of the company. EMS is a simple web application to use, 
the administrator can login or register in the system and manage the employees like update/delete/add new employee/edit employee. 
All this information is stored in a database and it is managed by the system.


The functions of this system are pretty simple, firstly, the user logs in to the management system but before he access into the application, 
an authentication must be made from the system in order for a successful operation into the software. 
Then the user can manage the employees by using the different functions which are: registering an employee, editing them or update them, 
and removing an employee.
